I was born in Isparta in 1997. After completing my primary and secondary education, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Ã–mer Halisdemir University. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at Konya Technical University. During this period, I came to Canada under the SICS scholarship provided by the Canadian Government, and I am conducting research at the NTN Laboratory, Carleton University, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Halim YanÄ±komeroÄŸlu. My research topics include HAPS, 6G communications, IoT technologies, and applications based on Artificial Intelligence. I plan to return to Turkey in April 2024. With three years of industry experience, I have been involved in R&D activities related to embedded software, hardware, and industrial automation. I am open to collaborations.
